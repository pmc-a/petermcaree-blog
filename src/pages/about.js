      <h1>About</h1>
      
      <p>PeteScript is a technical blog about everything related to web development and JavaScript.</p>
        
      <h3>Who?</h3>
      <p>I am a Belfast-based software engineer with a passion for JavaScript. Currently working with React, Redux and Node.js - building something great.</p>

      <h3>How?</h3>
      <p>You may think this looks and feels like every other technical blog, because it is. Or it's built with the same technologies, at least. Scaffolded by the Gatsby Starter Blog, I've plugged in Netlify CMS to write and deploy the content.</p>

      <p>All of the content and code is open source, and you can find it <a href="https://github.com/pmc-a/petermcaree-blog">here</a></p>
